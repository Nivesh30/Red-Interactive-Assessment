# Red-Interactive-Assessment
Web Development Assessment

We hope you find this as enjoyable as we do, and we’ll be back in touch in 5 working days to go through your results. 

Requirements of this assessment:
-	The front-end needs to be developed with HTML/CSS
-	The backend needs to be developed in NodeJS
-	The text on the page must be provided by a REST API endpoint from your server
-	The source code will need to be provided in a ZIP file, or in a public git repository of your choice (Please exclude the node_modules folder)
Some tips:
-	Use ExpressJS as your backend server to serve the text content for the page
o	Example: /api/page  Returns a JSON object of all text strings used on the page.
-	Take your time to plan and prioritise your tasks
Not a requirement, but will give yourself an edge:
-	Use VueJS as the frontend framework – we recommend using Vite for your build tooling
-	Utilise a CSS pre-processor such as SASS
-	Responsive UI for Mobile/tablet/desktop
